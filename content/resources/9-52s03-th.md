description: People's intuitive domain theories generate hypothesis spaces for concepts
  that could explain the features of objects that they observe. These hypothesis spaces
  can then be used to dramatically speed up learning, enabling people to generalize
  new features from very few examples. (Image by Prof. Joshua Tenenbaum.)
